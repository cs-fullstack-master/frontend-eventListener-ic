# Event Listener IC
#### Create an HTML file for each problem, one JS file, and one CSS file
### Problem 1:
Create a h1 element with the text "Teacher". Create a button with the text "Next". Given the array ["Kenn", "Kevin", "Erin"] change the text in the h1 element by iterating through the names when the button is clicked.

### Problem 2:
Create a simple grid system as seen in the attached picture. Make a button in the main section that can add a “*” to a p element in the footer.

### Problem 3:
Using the simple grid system from problem 2 make all the background colors yellow. Put one button in each section. Using only one function, click each button to change the associated background of the clicked button to purple. Use classlist to change the background.
