### Problem 1:
Create a h1 element with "Teacher". Next create a button with "Next". Given the array ["Kenn", "Kevin", "Erin] change the text in the h1 element by iterating through the names when the button is clicked. It is still correct after the last name is undefined.

### Problem 2:
Create a simple grid system as seen in the attached picture. Make a button in the main section that can add a “*” to a p element and change/toggle the background color to yellow each time it's pressed. Use classlist to change the color.

### Problem 3:
Create a simple grid system as seen in the attached picture and make all the background colors yellow. Put one button in each section. Using only one function, click each button to change the associated background of the clicked button to purple. Use classlist to change the background.
